for C# devs ( if you did not get seasharp and C# I do not know what to tell you... ) 

In Python you can return multiple fruits from a same function, in some other langage it might not be a common thing but
here is an exemple to illustrate the logic/abstraction

def y(x):
	return x+1,x+2
  
'''

y(2) -> 3,4

'''
